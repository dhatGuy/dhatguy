### ğŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Joseph!

I'm a computer science graduate and a self taught full-stack developer with a passion for building scalable web applications and working across the entire stack. I've worked on several web applications that use React.js, Node.js, Typescript, Postgresql, and GraphQL. 

I love reading tech articles during spare time and also working to be a consistent technical writer. 

I'm looking forward to working with a team and sharpening my skills and trying out new technologies.
